## A-Four-Staged-Pipelined-16-bit-ALU

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a 4-stage pipelined Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The ALU is capable of performing a range of arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as logical operations like AND, OR, XOR, and various shift operations. By utilizing a pipelined architecture, the ALU processes multiple instructions simultaneously, improving efficiency by reducing idle time between operations and allowing faster overall execution. 

The Verilog implementation breaks the ALU into four pipeline stages, each handling a specific part of the instruction flow. This division optimizes resource use and instruction handling, allowing the ALU to operate at a higher speed. The project also includes a detailed testbench that applies different test cases with varied input combinations and operation codes to ensure that the ALU produces correct results for all supported operations. The testbench is essential in verifying the functionality and reliability of the ALU design, ensuring accurate execution across a variety of scenarios.

This project demonstrates the practical benefits of pipelining in ALU design, enabling high-performance processing and efficient execution of both arithmetic and logical operations.
